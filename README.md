The purpose of this project is to see socioeconomic conditions (income, unemployment, family structure, and education levels) relate to high school academic performance measured by ACT/SAT scores. By combining EdGap data with NCES school information, the project aims to highlight patterns and disparities in educational outcomes across schools.
